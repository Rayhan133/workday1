    <p><h4> <mark>Wikipedia</mark> is an online free-content encyclopedia project that aims to help create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of openly editable content. The name "Wikipedia" is a blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles 
        provide links designed to guide 
        the user to related pages with additional 
        information.</h4></p>
